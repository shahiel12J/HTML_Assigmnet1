        <p>
            A street racer who is framed for a crime and seeks to clear his name by competing in an underground race 
            known as the De Leon. Need for Speed is an average action film that is likely to appeal to fans of the 
            video game series, but may not resonate with a wider audience. It's a film that is mostly focused on the 
            action and racing scenes rather than having a well-developed plot or characters.
