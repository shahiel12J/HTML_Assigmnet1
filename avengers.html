            Avengers: Endgame is the fourth and final installment of the Avengers franchise, and serves as the culmination
            of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) that began with Iron Man in 2008. The film picks up where 
            Avengers: Infinity War left off, with the villain Thanos having wiped out half of all life in the universe. 
            The remaining Avengers and their allies set out to undo Thanos' actions and bring back those who were lost.
